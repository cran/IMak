\description{
\code{build_fa} generates the information of figural analogies.
}
\details{
The argument \code{isomorphs} is the number of isomorphic
items to be created. The arguments \code{main.rot},
\code{mirror}, \code{trap.rot}, \code{subtract}, and
\code{dot.mov} are the so-called radical arguments.
They designate how rules are applied to all the isomorphs.
\code{main.rot} and \code{mirror} cannot be combined
because it is unpractical (Blum et al., 2016).
The arguments \code{a.main.rot}, \code{a.flip},
\code{a.trap}, and \code{a.dot} are the so-called
incidental arguments. They affect how the upper-left shape
of the main matrix (i.e., Figure A) presents itself in
every isomorph. Setting \code{constrict} to \code{"main"},
\code{"trap"} or \code{"dot"} displays all possible
positions of a certain part of Figure A (main shape,
trapezium or dot) every 'n' isomorphs.
Radical arguments that use the prefix \code{al.} designate
alternative solutions for each of the applied rules
throughout the options by following a Solutions Combination
Design (Blum et al., 2016). They are random by default when
\code{automatic=T}. When \code{automatic=F}, values must be
chosen, which designate rotation angles between the correct
and the alternative solutions, or alternative mirroring /
subtraction / dot positions. Three things to keep in mind:
1. Three alternative solutions should be chosen for the
main rule when working with only one rule. If
\code{add.rule} is not altered, then all other rules should
also comprise one alternative solution each. If
\code{add.rule} designates a specific rule from 1 to 5,
then the latter statement is only valid for this rule.
2. Two alternative solutions should be chosen for each rule
of two-rule-based items.
3. One alternative solution should be chosen for each rule
of items comprising more than two rules.

\examples{
## Create two isomorphs with one rule, setting the correct answer to 1:
one <- build_fa(isomorphs = 2, dot.mov = c(1, 2), correct = 1)
## Plot them:
plot_fa(one)

## Create four isomorphs with two rules:
two <- build_fa(isomorphs = 4, main.rot = c(180, 135), trap.rot = c(90, 45))
## Plot them:
plot_fa(two)

## Create 20 isomorphs with three rules. Set automatic=F and affect the options:
three <- build_fa(isomorphs = 20, mirror = 1, trap.rot = c(90, 45), dot.mov = c(1, 2),
automatic = FALSE, al.mirror = c(0, 1), al.trap.rot = -45, al.dot.mov = 1)
## Plot them:
plot_fa(three)

## Create and plot four two-rule based isomorphs, all of them comprising the same Figure A:
four <- build_fa(isomorphs = 4, a.main = 1, a.flip = FALSE, a.trap = 2, a.dot = 6,
mirror = 1, subtract = "R")
plot_fa(four)

## Create and plot 16 isomorphs by constricting the main shape rotation rule:
five <- build_fa(isomorphs = 16, subtract = c(1, 4), constrict = "main")
plot_fa(five)
